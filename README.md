Image Classifier using TensorFlow
Welcome to the Image Classifier using TensorFlow project! This powerful tool leverages TensorFlow to build a highly accurate image classification system. Ideal for various applications such as object detection, automated image tagging, and more, this project is designed to be user-friendly and highly customizable. It includes features like real-time image classification, a pre-trained model for quick setup, and the capability to train the model with your own custom dataset for recognizing new classes. The classifier utilizes advanced neural network architectures to ensure high accuracy in image recognition tasks.

To get started, make sure you have Python 3.6+, TensorFlow 2.x, and other required libraries listed in requirements.txt. Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the necessary dependencies. Configure the system by updating config.json with your model and dataset paths. You can run the image classifier by initializing the ImageClassifier class and calling the classify_images method. If you need to train the model, use the train_model.py script with your dataset to define the paths for training data and labels, and specify parameters like epochs and batch size.
